Implement some idea of working directory?

Shell-like functions (cp(), rm()) should take a table/array as 
well as varargs. This would make them easier to combine together.

Implement a proper serial keyboard interrupt. At present, we check at the
start of each Lua function whether ctrl+c has been pressed. This is
very inefficient. However, I don't know a way to get to the serial interrupt
from within the Pico C SDK. If there is a way, it's not documented.

Change %f to %g when the Pico SDK handles %g properly. Grrr!

Make editor indent behaviour configurable

Implement start-up script (which probably necessitates some way
to prevent it being executed if it tends to misbehave).
