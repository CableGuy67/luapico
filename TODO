Implement some idea of working directory?

Implement a proper serial keyboard interrupt. At present, we check at the
start of each Lua function whether ctrl+c has been pressed. This is
very inefficient. However, I don't know a way to get to the serial interrupt
from within the Pico C SDK. If there is a way, it's not documented.

Change %f to %g when the Pico SDK handles %g properly. Grrr!

"lua -" crashes

Document EDITOR_NO_INDENT and other shell variables
